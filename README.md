# EEG-ERP data and machinelearning 
Classify schizophrenia and Healthy by EEG data and machinelearning algorithm
With 9 channel, 3 times data augmentation [-0.5, 0.5] 0.001 random number was added, GridSearchCV is used
We found that KNN with best parameter classifying accuracy is 98% for test dataset, and 96% for validation dataset.
We will continue to find best EEG channel and best way to classify schizophrenia and healthy.
